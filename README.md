# SketchPlugins

We love Sketch here at [Each&Other](http://www.eachandother.com/). Occasionally we'll come across a problem worth writing a plugin for. When we do, you'll find it here.

## Plugins

###Artboards to pages
When the designers find it most comfortable to work with 'flat' Sketch files with a lot of artboards on a single page, and the developers find it quicker to work with pages with a single artboard on each of them. Running this on a page with several artboards will create a new page for each artboard, re-using the name of the artboard as a page name.


It will append an index number at the end of each new page so duplicates don't happen. It also prompts you for a prefix and suffix for the page names, but this may be left blank. This was a quick and dirty plugin, but feel free to tweak it to your own needs.

Cheers!
