Occasionally we'll come across a problem worth writing a plugin for. When we do, you'll find it here.\r\n\r\n## Plugins\r\n\r\n###Artboards to pages\r\nWhen the designers find it most comfortable to work with 'flat' Sketch files with a lot of artboards on a single page, and the developers find it quicker to work with pages with a single artboard on each of them. Running this on a page with several artboards will create a new page for each artboard, re-using the name of the artboard as a page name.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will append an index number at the end of each new page so duplicates don't happen. It also prompts you for a prefix and suffix for the page names, but this may be left blank. This was a quick and dirty plugin, but feel free to tweak it to your own needs.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n### Dev team\r\n@ColmMcBarron\r\n@IanHuet\r\n@ConorLuddy\r\n@Becco\r\n@RicheyRyan\r\n@adrn01\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
